        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p>I have programming experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, XML, HTML, and CSS. I have created two projects during my time at RMIT, one in Python
          using the Pygame module, and one in Java and XML. I gained web design experience when I designed my first website in
          Intro to Information Technology with the help of a template.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>I see myself as both a programmer and designer due to my experience working in a team, and solo studying each subject. </p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>I have been brought to this course to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology. But, I would love to do this course regardless of my affiliation with
          the degree because I desire to create websites for my future companies, and web programming is an essential for software engineers.</p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>I am hoping to hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while also obtaining a great amount of knowledge in PHP.</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p>The websites that I use the most in my life range from Instagram, Spotify, and Vestiaire Collective to RMIT, Trello, and Udemy.</p>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p>My main interest is IT, specifically in the areas of software engineering and artificial intelligence, but I have many other interests.
          Some of my interests include MMA, fashion, and music.</p>
